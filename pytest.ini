# Developer Notes:
# - Path: quality_configs/pytest.ini
# - Purpose: Basic pytest configuration for the MVP.
# - Defines test paths and Python file/class/function naming conventions.
# - Source: T-010 development, replacing existing minimal pytest.ini.
# - Evidence: PRO PLAN v4.0 (T-010 requirements).

[pytest]
# Look for tests in files named test_*.py or *_test.py
python_files = test_*.py *_test.py

# Look for test methods and functions prefixed with test_
python_functions = test_*

# Look for test classes prefixed with Test
python_classes = Test*

# Add options for more verbose output or specific plugins if needed later
# addopts = -ra -q

# Define where pytest should look for tests (relative to where pytest is run)
# Default is current directory, which is usually fine for the runner's CWD.
testpaths = tests  # If tests are always in a 'tests' subdirectory within CODE_TO_SCAN_DIR

# Note: PYTHONPATH for imports within the tests will depend on the structure
# of the code being scanned. If the scanned code is a package, it might need
# to be installed or PYTHONPATH adjusted for tests to import modules correctly.
# For the MVP artifact (Simple Quote API), tests are in a 'tests' subdir,
# and `app.py` is at the root of the scanned code, so imports should be simple.
